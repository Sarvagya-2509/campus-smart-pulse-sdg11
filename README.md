# campus-smart-pulse-sdg11
Contains detail about the campus smart pulse sdg11
## Overview
Campus Smart Pulse is a  project aligned with SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities). It proposes a campus- scale system that allows students to report infrastructure and sustainability-related issues and enables administrators to track and analyze them efficiently.
The project focuses on demonstrating feasibility and workflow through a MVP.

## Problem Statement
University campuses function like small cities but often lack a simple, unified platform for reporting and tracking issues such as waste management, lighting failures, and infrastructure problems.
Existing methods are usually inefficient in proper implementation of solutions

## Proposed Solution
The solution introduces a centralized reporting workflow where:
- Users access a simple app interface.
- Issues are reported using Google Forms
- Submitted data is automatically stored in Google Sheets
- Administrators can review and analyze reported issues
This MVP validates the idea without requiring backend development.

## SDG Alignment
SDG 11 – Sustainable Cities and Communities
The project promotes sustainable campus management by enabling faster identification and resolution of infrastructure and environmental issues.

## MVP Implementation (Current)
The MVP consists of:
- A Figma clickable prototype to demonstrate app flow
- A Google Formfor actual issue reporting
- Google Sheets for automatic data storage

This setup represents a functional, minimal implementation focusedon validating user interaction and data flow.

## Google Technologies Used:
### Used in MVP
- Google Forms – Issue reporting
- Google Sheets – Data storage and tracking
### Proposed for Full Implementation
- Google Maps API – Location tagging
- Firebase – Authentication and real-time database
- Google Cloud Platform – Backend services
- Google Looker Studio – Analytics dashboard

## Architecture
The implemented MVP follows this flow:

User -> Figma Prototype -> Google Form -> Google Sheets -> Admin
This architecture represents a conceptual workflow for a campus- level pilot system.

## Future Scope
- Integration with Google Maps API for live campus maps
- Authentication using Firebase
- Real-time dashboards using Looker Studio
- Full mobile application development
- Expansion beyond campus to smart-city scale
